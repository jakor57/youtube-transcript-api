## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To install the YouTube Transcript API, you can use pip. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install youtube-transcript-api
```

This command will download and install the library and its dependencies.

## Usage üìñ

Using the YouTube Transcript API is simple. Below are some basic examples to get you started.

### Importing the Library

```python
from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi
```

### Fetching a Transcript

To fetch the transcript of a video, use the following code:

```python
transcript = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript('VIDEO_ID')
print(transcript)
```

Replace `VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID of the YouTube video.

### Handling Errors

You can handle errors using try-except blocks. Here‚Äôs an example:

```python
from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi, TranscriptsDisabled, VideoNotAvailable

try:
    transcript = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript('VIDEO_ID')
except TranscriptsDisabled:
    print("Transcripts are disabled for this video.")
except VideoNotAvailable:
    print("This video is not available.")
```

### Additional Features

You can also retrieve transcripts in different languages. Use the `languages` parameter:

```python
transcript = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript('VIDEO_ID', languages=['en', 'es'])
```

This will attempt to fetch the transcript in English first, and then in Spanish if available.
